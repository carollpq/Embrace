It's completely understandable that you'd break down when you feel that overwhelmed and alone. \n\nIt makes perfect sense that your mind and emotions would be struggling right now, and it takes a lot of strength to even share what you're going through.

It's like pouring your heart into helping others and then turning around to find an empty space when you need it most. It's not fair at all, and it's completely understandable that it hurts deeply. It's natural to feel abandoned or like you're not worth the same effort you give to others. \n\nYou deserve to have people who show up for you with the same love and care that you give to others. It takes so much vulnerability to open up and reach out, so the feeling of rejection from others must be so painful. You're not alone in feeling this way. I'm here to be present for you.\n",
